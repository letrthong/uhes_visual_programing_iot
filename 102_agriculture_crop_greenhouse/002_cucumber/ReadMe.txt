Cucumbers are produced in integrated hydroponic and aquaculture systems (aquaponics). 
Aquaponics balances pH for plants, fish, and nitrifying bacteria. Nitrification prevents
 buildup of toxic waste ammonia by conversion to nitrate (NO3 −)- nitrogen (N).
 The pH for hydroponic cucumbers (5.5–6.0) and nitrification (7.5–9.0) requires 
 reconciliation to improve systems integration. Cucumbers were grown at pH of 5.0, 6.0,
 7.0, and 8.0 with additional foliar sprays at pH 7.0 and 8.0. Plant shoot dry weight,
 length, N, and phosphorus (P) content at 14 DAT were similar from pH 5.0 to 7.0, but 
 reduced at pH 8.0. Nutrient solution and shoot dry matter Mn and Fe decreased as pH increased.
 Foliar sprays had no effect on cucumber fruit yield. Early yield was higher at pH 5.0 
 compared to pH 8.0 but total yield was unaffected by pH. Cucumbers in recirculating 
 culture may be maintained at pH levels more optimum for nitrification (7.5–8.0) except
 during production for early season markets.
